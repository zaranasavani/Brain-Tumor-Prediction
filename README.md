#  ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN



Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project! This project is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from medical images. The goal is to provide an AI-based solution to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- TensorFlow & Keras for CNN model
- OpenCV for image processing
- Matplotlib for visualizing accuracy and loss
- Joblib for saving the model
- Python as the core programming language

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow
* Image Loading & Preprocessing: Images are loaded from the dataset and resized to 256x256 pixels. They are then normalized for better model performance.
* CNN Model: A deep learning model that consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to classify brain tumor images.
* Training: The model is trained on a set of labeled brain tumor images.
* Testing: After training, the model is tested on unseen images to evaluate its performance.

##  AI Concepts
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Feature extraction and classification.
- Adam Optimizer: Optimizes the model's performance.
- Binary Cross-Entropy: Loss function for binary classification.
