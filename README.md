#  ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN



Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project! This project is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from medical images. The goal is to provide an AI-based solution to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- TensorFlow & Keras for CNN model
- OpenCV for image processing
- Matplotlib for visualizing accuracy and loss
- Joblib for saving the model
- Python as the core programming language
